# Radically kind honesty: A Manifesto

I have a lot of sympathy for the ideals behind _Radical honesty_. However, it
is often used in practice as a way to justify hurtfulness.

(I feel the same about libertarianism: while, in principle, it appeals to me,
in practice it is more often used to justify an ethics of selfishness than an
ethics of personal responsibility.)

So, here is my manifesto for a _radically kind honesty_!

1. Do not lie (that is, _do not say any untruths_).

   This one should be clear. This is still a manifesto for honesty.

2. Lying by omission is still lying if you are creating the wrong impression in
   the person.

   Similarly, honesty means that you must say what you must actively engage
   with misconceptions.

3. Open candor instead of brutal honesty.

   Candor is soft-spoken and empathic, not _brutal_.

   Consider the classical _Does this dress make me look fat?_ Assuming it,
   indeed, make the wearer look fat, the candid answer says _it does not
   flatter you_. It answers the question honestly (without ambiguity), while
   attempting to minimize pain.

4. Sometimes, the honest thing to do is to refuse to answer the question.
